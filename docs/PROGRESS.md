# TradeWinds — Progress Log

What is done, and pitfalls hit on the way. Newest stage first. Read
`TRADEWINDS_SPEC.md` for requirements; this file records reality.

## Stage 0 — Addon scaffold (2026-07-29) — CODE COMPLETE, awaiting in-game test

**Done:**
- Maven project (`pom.xml` cloned from GushBlock's verified 26.2 toolchain:
  Paper API `26.2.build.40-alpha`, BentoBox 3.18.1, JDK 25 / release 21,
  patched MockBukkit `4.113.4-p262`, surefire `--add-opens` set, JaCoCo).
- `TradeWinds extends GameModeAddon` (AcidIsland lifecycle pattern):
  overworld `tradewinds_world` + interstice `tradewinds_world_nether`
  (NETHER environment), **no End world ever** (spec principle 7).
  `/tw` + `/twadmin` via Default{Player,Admin}Command; both default player
  actions are `spawn` since TradeWinds players own no island at first.
- `ChunkGeneratorWorld`: ocean everywhere — bedrock, solid base, Perlin ocean
  floor (8 octaves, scale 1/30, ±25 amplitude from `sea-floor` 25), water to
  `sea-height` 70. Interstice identical shape with netherrack/basalt/soul-sand
  palette. Vanilla noise/surface OFF so no vanilla continents can appear.
  `terrainScale(worldInfo, x, z)` hook is where Stage 1's radial island mask
  multiplies in.
- `TradeWindsBiomeProvider`: sea/air biome split (Poseidon pattern), interstice
  biome for NETHER. Defaults OCEAN / OCEAN / NETHER_WASTES.
- `Settings` adapted from Gusher's (full WorldSettings), plus Stage 0 skeleton
  knobs: `galaxy.*` (seed, min-separation, starter cluster), `travel.warp.*`
  (fuel-per-block, failure-chance), `illegal-trade.enabled` master gate.
- Tests: 22, all green — Settings defaults, addon lifecycle incl. world
  creation via ServerMock, generator shape/determinism/palette/terrainScale
  hook, biome provider.

**Pitfalls:**
- `org.bukkit.block.Biome` static init died in tests: 26.2 added
  `minecraft:sulfur_caves` and the patched MockBukkit's `keyed/worldgen/biome.json`
  lacked it. Fixed by adding `worldgen/biome` to the KEYED diff map in
  `scripts/build_patched_mockbukkit.py` (note the registry file is under
  `keyed/worldgen/`, not `keyed/`). Script re-run, artifact reinstalled, and the
  updated script synced back to `~/git/GushBlock/scripts/` so a rerun there
  cannot clobber the shared `~/.m2` artifact without the biome entries.
- Use `getServer().getWorld(...)` (not `Bukkit.getWorld`) in `createWorlds()` —
  ServerMock backs it in tests, and `WorldCreator.createWorld()` resolves
  through the mocked server, so world creation is fully unit-testable.

**Interstice inaccessibility (Stage 0 accept):** `world.nether.create-and-link-portals`
is false so BentoBox never links portals into the interstice; there is no
command that goes there. Verify on the live server per `TESTING.md` — if some
other plugin (Multiverse) offers a route in, revisit with a listener at Stage 5.

## Pre-Stage 0 (2026-07-29)

- `TRADEWINDS_SPEC.md` written (consolidates overview/design-decisions/dev-plan;
  spec wins on conflict). `CLAUDE.md` per GushBlock pattern.
- Reference intel gathered: AcidIsland (GameModeAddon anatomy, boat handling),
  Poseidon (ocean noise), GushBlock (26.2 toolchain + MockBukkit patching),
  BlueBook (`PriceEngine.getPrice(ItemStack, worldName)`), Border (visual
  border, `BorderShower` API, `barrier-offset`/passable behavior).
